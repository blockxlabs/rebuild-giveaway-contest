This is a repo for the contest we initiated on Friday April 12th on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6522477165399932928/)

The entrents will be given numbers based on the amount of entries won. This list will be hashed, made public on this repo and then stored on the blockchain to be certain of no tampering. 

Next we will generated a psudo-random number and the contestent who maps to that number will win. Contestents can only win one ticket if they win more than one we will select a new random number.

If an individual has won a ticket already the previous individual will be the next winner.
